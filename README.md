<pre>I'm excited to share my latest project- a calculator with advanced features like logarithms, factorials, a π (pi) button, square root calculations and trigonometric calculations! 🌟 This project was a fantastic opportunity to enhance my web development skills and apply concepts in JavaScript for interactive functionality.
Key Features:
✅ Basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
✅ Sine, cosine, and tangent calculations (Degree-to-radian conversion)
✅ Advanced functions (logarithm, factorial, square root, π)
✅ Clean, user-friendly design with HTML and CSS
✅ Responsive and efficient code
It's been a rewarding experience, and I'm eager to explore more in the realm of web development! ✨
