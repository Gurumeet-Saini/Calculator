<pre>I'm excited to share my latest project- a calculator with advanced features like logarithms, factorials,<br>a Ï€ (pi) button, square root calculations and trigonometric calculations! ðŸŒŸ This project was a fantastic opportunity<br>to enhance my web development skills and apply concepts in JavaScript for interactive functionality.
Key Features:
âœ… Basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
âœ… Sine, cosine, and tangent calculations (Degree-to-radian conversion)
âœ… Advanced functions (logarithm, factorial, square root, Ï€)
âœ… Clean, user-friendly design with HTML and CSS
âœ… Responsive and efficient code
It's been a rewarding experience, and I'm eager to explore more in the realm of web development! âœ¨</pre>
